One challenge for data science and data science processes is that they do not always accommodate the real-time and evolving nature of data science advice as required, for example in pandemic response or in managing an international supply chain. The Fynesse paradigm is inspired by experience in operational data science both in the Amazon supply chain and in the UK Covid-19 pandemic response.

The Fynesse paradigm considers three aspects to data analysis, Access, Assess, Address.
